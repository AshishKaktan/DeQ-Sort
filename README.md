This post presents a new algorithm called DeQ insertion sort that enhances the performance of bubble sort and insertion sort by reducing the swaps to zero and decreasing the number of comparison. The result from the implementation of the algorithm compared with insertion and bubble sort showed that the algorithm performed better than the other in the worst case scenario.
In general O(n^2) sorting algorithm runs slower than O(nLogn) therefore DeQ insertion algorithm sort reduces the worst case of insertion and bubble sort to the complexity of O(n) and general average case complexity O(n^2).
