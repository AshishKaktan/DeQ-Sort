Step 1 : We start with first element and push if Queue is empty.
 
Step 2 : For every next element check if it is smaller than the front of queue and greater than the rear of queue
Step 3 : If it is smaller,
	 and min stack is empty, push at front of queue
         if min stack is not empty,
           and if element is less than top of min stack,
	       then apply pop operation on min stack and push at front of queue till top of min stack is greater than element or min stack is empty.
	   push element in min stack
	   else if element is greater or equal to top of min stack
	       then push element in min stack    
	If it is greater,
	and max stack is empty, push at rear of queue
	if max stack is not empty,
          and if element is greater than top of max stack,
	      then apply pop operation on max stack and push at rear of queue till top of max stack is smaller than element or max stack is empty.
	  push element in max stack

	  else if max is greater than equal to element
		then push element in max stack
        
	If element is greater than front of queue and less than rear of queue,
	  then push front of queue in min stack and rear of queue in max stack until element is greater than queue front and less than queue rear.
	  
	  if queue is empty or element is less than equal to front of queue,
	     push element in front of queue
	  else
 	     push element in rear of queue

        Repeat step 3 until last element is processed

Step 4 : if min stack is not empty.
  	     push all elements of min stack in front of queue
	 if max stack is not empty
  	     push all elements of max stack in rear of queue
